Copyright (C) 2025 Axel Koolhaas

The frida-java library core, and other portions of the official frida-java
distribution not explicitly licensed otherwise, are licensed under the
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 3 or later -- see the
'COPYING.LESSER' file in this directory for details.

[ The below explicit exemption clarifies the frida-java developers' position
concerning the application of the GNU Lesser General Public License to
applications and libraries that use frida-java. The intention is to make it
clear that arbitrarily-licensed programs and libraries that use frida-java
do not automatically assume the LGPL license themselves simply because of
their use of frida-java APIs or linking to frida-java libraries: ]

EXEMPTION:

Applications and libraries that use frida-java through its public APIs,
whether statically or dynamically linked, are not considered derivative
works of frida-java for the purposes of the LGPL. Such applications and
libraries may be distributed under any license of the author's choosing,
provided that they comply with the LGPL requirements for the frida-java
library itself (such as providing source code for any modifications to
frida-java and ensuring users can replace the frida-java library).

This exemption applies to:
- Applications that use frida-java to perform dynamic instrumentation
- Libraries that wrap or extend frida-java functionality
- Native code that interfaces with frida-java through JNI
- Scripts and programs that are instrumented using frida-java

This exemption does not apply to:
- Modified versions of frida-java itself
- Code that incorporates frida-java source code directly
- Derivative works of the frida-java library core
